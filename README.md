# Excel_Summary
Create Summary tab within an Excel spreadsheet, from the tabs you want to summarise

I've added 2 different methods to achieve this;

Python method, Use the Python file method to create a Summary Tab within the Excel spreadsheet.

VB method, Add a VB macro within the excel spreadsheet, run the macro and then assign it to a button within the Summary page
